- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua (@jvandyke1993)
- 👀 I’m interested in:
           1) making programming scripts for my robots.
           2) making programs for use in white hat hacking.
           3) making a website called 4nationskungfu that takes "Avatar: The Last Airbender" and has articles on the kinds of kung fu used in this tv show.
           4) making a database that will be referenced as containing my kids 'homeschooling/no-schooling' syllabus. 
           5) making a bible based video game similar in gameplay to "Assassin's Creed" games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics, auto repair, and computer programming (HTML & CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C, C++).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a video game that tells the story of the bible in all its bloody detail. Not a 'churchy' game but one that really goes into the true history of the hebrew people and the mythology surrounding it.
