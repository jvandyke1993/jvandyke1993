- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua (@jvandyke1993)
- 👀 I’m interested in:
    1. making programming scripts for my robots.
    2. making programs for use in white hat hacking.
    3. making a website called 4nationskungfu that takes "Avatar: The Last Airbender" and has articles on the kinds of kung fu used in this tv show.
    4. making a database that will be referenced as containing my kids 'homeschooling/no-schooling' syllabus. 
    5. making video games on unreal engine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics, auto repair, and computer programming (HTML & CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C, C++).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a video game that has similar gameplay to that of "Assassin's Creed" but tells the story of the bible in all its bloody detail. Not a 'churchy' game but one that really goes into the true history of the hebrew people and the mythology surrounding it.
